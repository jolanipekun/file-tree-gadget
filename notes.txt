#1. A React component is basically a function that can be referenced in another file.

#2. Let say we have a piece of data string const name = 'john'; and we
------want to render this; all we have to do is wrap it in curly braces {name}
----i.e const try = () => {
    const name = 'John';
    return <h1> {name} </h1>
}

#3. A dynamic way to pass down data into our component is through props, and you initate the call from the App.js
---where the component is being represented and you recieve it down in the component through prop.name for example.#

#4. My assessment, everything in React is a component.

#5. Conditional rendering in React
--Again, my own opinion, boolean data structures like True / False, enables us to conditionally render items based on some conditions
--almost like toggle.
==This is also where we need to know about state, "State Management" 
    ===> That how we use hooks for conditional rendering.
